# Advanced Go Concurrency Pattern

This repository represents the code that used to be hosted on code.google.com for the 2013 [Advanced Go Concurrency Patterns](https://talks.golang.org/2013/advconc.slide#1) talk at [I/O](https://blog.golang.org/advanced-go-concurrency-patterns)... I think. I stumbled across it years ago, but couldn't find it again. I googled a unique string in the code and stumbled across [this playground link](https://play.golang.org/p/jEm8Pt-nH9), which I'm now preserving for posterity, here.

Enjoy.
